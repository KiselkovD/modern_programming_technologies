# Modern Programming Technologies

![Build Status](https://github.com/KiselkovD/modern_programming_technologies/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg)

## Description

This repository contains four assignments. Each assignment was developed in its own branch (except for the github_workflow branch) and has a corresponding folder.
After completing the main tasks, all branches were merged into the main branch for final adjustments.
Each folder includes a README file that describes the functionality of the respective assignment. Furthermore, GitHub CI has been implemented for both the io_flush and fractal assignments.
