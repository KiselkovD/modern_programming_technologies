## Description

This repository contains four assignments. Each assignment was developed in its own branch (except for the github_workflow branch) and has a corresponding folder.
Additionally, the base_proj folder demonstrates how to organize files within a project effectively. After completing the main tasks, all branches were merged into the main branch for final adjustments.
Each folder includes a README file that describes the functionality of the respective assignment. Furthermore, GitHub CI has been implemented for both the io_flush and fractal assignments.
